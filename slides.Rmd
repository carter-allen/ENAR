# Introduction: Infant Motor Development

- Infant motor development has been shown to be an important predictor of health later in life.

- Early motor development has been associated with improved physical activity, cognitive function, and educational attainment. 

- Delayed motor development has been linked to congnitive disorders in adulthood.

- __Interest lies in identifying factors related to differing developmental patterns.__

# Nurture Study

- Birth cohort of predominantly black women and their infants residing in the southeastern U.S. between 2013 and 2017

- Infant development was assessed quarterly through the first year of life at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age.

- __Bayley composite score__ was used to measure infant development. Scores range from 40 to 160, with higher scores indicating more advanced development.

- __Food security__ was assessed during pregnancy and infancy. It was hypothesized that _lack of food security during pregnancy contributes to slower motor development during infancy_.

# Statistical Challenges

- Standard repeated measures models of Bayley scores in the Nurture data feature __skewed residuals__.

- Bayley scores exhibit __intermittent missingness__, with approximately one third of Bayley scores missing at each timepoint. 

- Bayley scores are correlated through time in an __unstructured manner__.

- Existing approaches to modeling development clusters fail to account for one of more of these relevant features of the Nurture data.
